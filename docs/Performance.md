# Performance Tests

## Overview
- The performance tests were executed using Visual Studioâ€™s Diagnostics Tools. The results are stored in the **"docs/performance/PerformanceTest.diagsession"** file.
- These tests simulate high load conditions to evaluate system responsiveness, throughput, and resource utilization under stress.

## API Performance
**Response Time**
<br>
- Under stress conditions, the API maintained an average response time of approximately 150 ms, with peak response times not exceeding 250 ms.
<br><br>
**Throughput**
<br>
  - The system successfully handled up to 500 concurrent requests without significant degradation in performance.
<br><br>
**Resource Utilization**
<br>
  - Memory usage remained stable at around 200 MB during high load, and CPU usage peaked at approximately 75%.
<br><br>
**Error Rate**
<br>
  - No significant increase in errors was observed during the test, indicating robust handling of heavy traffic.

## Application and Infrastructure Performance
**Trie Structure Efficiency:**
<br>
  - The efficient implementation of the trie structure ensures fast search operations even with a large dataset.
<br><br>
**Data Update Performance:**
<br>
  - Background data updates and trie refresh operations are executed within acceptable time limits, minimizing the impact on live API performance.

## Observations and Recommendations
- The test results confirm that the system meets the required performance benchmarks.
- Minor optimizations (e.g., fine-tuning concurrency settings or enhancing caching mechanisms) could further improve performance.
- It is recommended to periodically re-run these performance tests to monitor system behavior as the dataset grows or as new features are added.
