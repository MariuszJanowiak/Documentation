#Summary and Future Improvements

##Current Project State
The project meets the recruitment requirements â€” the station search implementation is based on a trie structure, input validation is in place, data updates occur in the background, and comprehensive tests cover all layers of the system.

##Possible Extensions
- Expand the API with additional functionalities (e.g., station management, pricing, route information).
- Improve the search algorithm (e.g., further optimize the trie structure, add indexing).
- Extend the test suite with more detailed integration tests.
