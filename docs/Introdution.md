# Project Objective

The application implements an API for ticket machines that allows users to search for train stations based on a typed prefix. 

### The search result includes

- A list of matching stations
- Set of "next characters" (including spaces) â€“ that is, the characters that immediately follow the entered prefix. This information can be used in further operations (e.g., determining routes and ticket prices).

### Context
