# Security Testing Requirements

## API and Helper Module Security Tests
**`StationControllerTests.cs`** (TrainTicketMachine.API.Tests)
<br>
- Verifies that the GET /api/stations/search endpoint properly validates incoming requests:
- Returns a 400 Bad Request when the input contains potential XSS or SQL injection patterns.

**`InputValidatorTests.cs`**
<br>
- Confirms that input sanitization methods effectively remove script tags, event handler attributes, and the "javascript:" protocol to protect against XSS and SQL Injection attacks.
<br><br>
**`LoggerConfigurationTests.cs`**
<br>
- Ensures that the GetAndCreateLogFolder method securely handles invalid folder names and creates the proper log directory on various operating systems, preventing unauthorized access to log files.

<br><br>
## Application Layer Security Tests
**`StationSearchServiceTests.cs`** (TrainTicketMachine.Application.Tests)
<br>
- Validates that station names are cleaned and sanitized before processing, ensuring that malicious input is not stored or processed by the search functionality.
<br><br>
**`StationUpdateDatabaseServiceTests.cs`**
<br>
- Checks that the background update service securely handles exceptions during data updates, ensuring that sensitive information is not exposed.

<br><br>
## Domain and Infrastructure Security Tests
**`StationModelTests.cs`** (TrainTicketMachine.Domain.Tests)
<br>
- Verifies that the StationModel enforces proper validation of its data, ensuring only valid station entries are processed.
<br><br>
**`JsonUrlDataSourceTests.cs`** (TrainTicketMachine.Infrastructure.Tests)
<br>- Ensures that the data source correctly throws exceptions for malformed JSON, preventing invalid data from compromising the system.
<br><br>
**`StationRepositoryTests.cs`**
<br>
- Confirms that the repository safely handles empty or invalid data collections without exposing security vulnerabilities.
